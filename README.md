# Complete-DSA-Java
The (rough) codes of the 48 Hour course by Dinesh Varyani (Free Code Camp).
I added all my findings and code in a singular NotePad(I know not ideal).
Some codes may be missing as I felt them to be too easy (Like Linear Search).
I have included(at some points) my own code as well (which I implemented by my own or I felt them to be more efficient/similarly efficient).
At some points, only the function is included instead of the whole thing (Hope you can understand).
Again, Big thanks to Dinesh Varyani and FreeCodeCamp.
